# Mazes For Programmers

C# implementation of the maze creation algorithms in Jamis Buck's excellent ["Mazes for Programmers"](https://pragprog.com/book/jbmaze/mazes-for-programmers) book.

Initially this will be a direct implementation of the original Ruby code in C# (where I can understand the Ruby syntax!), but I'm hoping to bring in some functional programming techniques to see if the code can be simplified or made more efficient.
